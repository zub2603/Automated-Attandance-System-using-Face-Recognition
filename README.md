Recording the attendance of students at various educational institutes on a daily basis has been a challenge for a long time. Different institutes practice/implement different practices like maintaining a physical attendance register by manually recording by callouts, class representatives recording daily lists to the lecturers/teachers etc. People have also put in place some technical solutions like access control, biometric reader, barcode/QR code submissions, etc. But so far none of them have been fully comprehensive towards adequate interpretations. Some involve too much manual effort whereas, some have flaws of misappropriation. Biometric can be referred to the use of statistical analysis on biological data which makes each and every individual different from the other. Using biometrics one can be identified differently. In regard to this development in every field is evolving and is being converted into an automated system. Just to have a system that would take up less time to execute, and reduce manual errors and the use of resources. Thus, we thought of developing a face recognition linked attendance solution. The complexity of a face's features is the results of the ongoing changes in facial features which happens over time. Despite these changes, we can still recognize a person relatively quickly. Therefore, the thought of having machines imitate this ability that humans have natively, can be quite useful. Here in the solution we have come up with something that would work on real-time, the tool would recognize the faces and tally with the repository/database provided and mark the attendance for presence, further it will generate required report and make it visible to the students and the professors. The data would be made available on MySQL. Our proposed idea intends on automatically recording oneâ€™s attendance using face recognition. The proposed method here will eradicate most of the challenges observed in the previous methods used and will be of great help in the coming times. Method being based on face recognition and detection, subparts of image processing, it would give a high accuracy performance rate. Since the reports are recorded and stored on an online database, the records can be reviewed as in when required.
